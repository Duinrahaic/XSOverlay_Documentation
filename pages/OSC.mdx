OSC (Open Sound Control) is a protocol used for communicating between applications. XSOverlay, by default, is configured to send OSC messages on port `9000`. XSOverlay does not listen for OSC messages.  This can be changed by editing
This can be changed by editing the `ExternalMessageAPIConfig.json` file located in the `[XSOverlayInstallDirectory]/XSOverlay_Data/StreamingAssets/Plugins/Config/` directory.


### OSC Configuration

| Option | Description | Default Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `OscSendPort` | The port XSOverlay sends to OSC messages on. | `9000` |
| `OscListenPort` | The port XSOverlay listens to OSC messages on (UNUSED). | `9001` |
| `OscOutputPath` | The base OSC address that is appended on each parameter. | `/avatar/parameters/` |

Changes to this file will require a restart of XSOverlay to take effect.

<Callout>
    You will likely need to use a port number between `20000` and `49150`. It is not advised to configure XSOverlay to use ports outside of this range as it conflict with ports allocated to your operating system or subsystem services

The following OSC parameters are sent by XSOverlay:
| Parameter | Description | Type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `leftControllerBattery` | Left Controller Battery Percentage (Range: 0 - 1) | Float |
| `rightControllerBattery` | Right Controller Battery Percentage (Range: 0 - 1) | Float |
| `averageControllerBattery` | Average Controller Battery Percentage (Range: 0 - 1) | Float |
