# Output Logs
<Callout type="warning">
_Output logs can be found at `%AppData%/LocalLow/Xiexe/XSOverlay/output_logs/output_log_[DATE]_[TIME].txt`_
</Callout>

_Output logs can contain very useful information for debugging things such as [Notifications sent via our Notification API](Developer/api/websockets/apicommands#sendnotification), as each Notification will send a log output, and will log Errors with the formatting if there are any._
