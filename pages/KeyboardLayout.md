# Keyboard Layout
!> As of build 357 Keyboard layouts are automatically determined based on the language selected in Windows. This is done by remapping Scan Codes to Virtual Keycodes, and then updating the virtual keyboard to reflect what the Windows APIs return from that. This currently supports both ANSI and ISO format keyboards.

!> The Default base layout is located at `[XSOverlayInstallationDirectory]/XSOverlay_Data/StreamingAssets/Plugins/KeyboardLayout/Keyboard.json`

# Keyboard Key Object
> Each Key is an Object and can have various entires that all have defaults.

```cs
{
    // The Scan Code of the primary key, or Virtual Key Code if useVirtualKeyCode is true.
    string keycode; 
    
    // Can contain a list of Scan Codes / Virtual Key Codes that will be sent in the order of the list. "keycodes" : ["k1", "k2", etc]
    // Do not use "keycode" and "keycodes" together in the same object, as it is unsupported behavior and may cause issues.
    List<string> keycodes; 

    // Can be "light", "mid", "dark", or "contrast" - Picks the respective color from the global theme.
    string color = "light";
    
    // Can be "error", "confirm", "warning", or "default" - Same as Color, but for the highlight color
    string highlightColor = "default";
    
    // Can be "mute", "standard", "backspace", "spacebar", or "enter". May change in the future 
    string audio = "standard";
    
    // Can be "spacebar", "caps", "tab", "enter", "backspace", "windows", "context", "up", "down", "left", or "right" - Will set an image instead of a label on the key.
    string icon = "";

    // Overrides the automatic label detection for the key. 
    string label = "";

    // Secondary label that appears in the bottom right corner of the key, can be used for things like JIS layout that shows Kana on keys with Romanji
    string secondaryLabel = "";

    // Key Width Multiplier. 1 will results in the width defined in the json. 2 would be Width * 2.
    float width = 1;
    
    // Key Height Multiplier, same as width, but changes the height instead.
    float height = 1;
    
    // Changes the font size of the key Main Label
    float fontSize = 38;

    // Changes the icon size
    float iconSize = 34;
    
    // Currently unused.
    bool stretch = false;
    
    // Makes the key text respect when Caps Lock is pressed for visuals
    bool respectCapsLock = false;

    // To be used as a standalone flag, for creating space. Don't use a keycode with a space. Can change width and height.
    bool spacer = false;

    // Determines if the key remains pressed when clicked -- will unpress when selecting any non sticky key.
    bool sticky = false;
    
    // Determines if the key is a toggle key, will remain pressed until pressed again manually.
    bool toggle = false;

    // Specifies that "keycode" or "keycodes" already contains a mapped VirtualKeyCode, and does not need to be mapped from a Scan Code.
    bool useVirtualKeyCode = false;
